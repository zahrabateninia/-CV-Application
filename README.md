# CV Application

## Description
CV Application is a React-based web app designed to help users easily create a basic CV. It allows users to input personal information, education, and work experience, which is then dynamically rendered as a CV preview. Users can also export their CV as a PDF using the `jsPDF` and `html2Canvas` libraries. The project is built using `Vite` for fast builds and includes icons from `React Icons` with FontAwesome integration for a modern look.
